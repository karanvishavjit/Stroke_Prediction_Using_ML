# Stroke_Prediction_Using_ML

Stroke remains a significant health concern for
individuals and public health systems as it is the second most
common cause of death globally. This perilous condition occurs
when the supply of oxygen and nutrients to a part of the brain is
obstructed, resulting in the death of brain cells within minutes.
The majority of strokes are comprised of ischemic, embolic,
and hemorrhagic types. The objective of the proposed solution
to predict the stroke among people and provide treatment for
same. The main objective of the proposed solution is to apply
the various classification algorithms over the existing datasets
and predict whether the person will be affected by stroke or not
based on its values such as smoking status, BP, hypertension and
etc. Employing diverse classification algorithms would yield an
overall perspective regarding the precision of each classification
in anticipating strokes.
